# Hack for LA Marketing

The Hack for LA Marketing team works to create structure for our projects and for the organization.

### Project context

Much of hack for LA's recent marketing has centered around the website http://hackforla.org.  In the past, we had a active presence on social media (twitter in particular).  We aim to rebuild our social media capacity so that we can share the organizational growth, workforce development and project impact that Hack for LA has achieved over the intervening time.
